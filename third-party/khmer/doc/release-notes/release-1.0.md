The team has been hard at work since v0.8 to refine the codebase into a stable product.

https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

With the 1.0 release we are making a commitment to using Semantic Versioning[0]: the version number will reflect the impact of the changes between releases. New major versions will likely require you to change how you use the project. Minor versions indicate new functionality that doesn't impact the existing. Patch versions indicate backwards-compatible fixes. Right now we are limiting this promise to the command-line interface. A future release will introduce a stable and mature Python API to the khmer project and at that time we will extend the version system to include that API.

## New items of note:

CITATION: Each script now outputs information on how to cite it. There is a new paper to describes the project overall: MR Crusoe et al., 2014. doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.979190

The documentation for the scripts has undergone an overhaul. The scripts now output extensive notes and the formal documentation website is generated from the scripts themselves and will never be out of sync.

## Known Issues

All of these are pre-existing.

Some users have reported that normalize-by-median.py will utilize more
memory than it was configured for. This is being investigated in
https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/266

Some FASTQ files confuse our parser when running with more than one thread.
For example, while using load-into-counting.py. If you experience this then
add "--threads=1" to your command line. This issue is being tracked in
https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/249

If your k-mer table (hashfile) gets truncated, perhaps from a full filesystem, then our
tools currently will get stuck. This is being tracked in https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/247 and https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/96 and https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/246

Paired-end reads from Casava 1.8 currently require renaming for use in
normalize-by-median and abund-filter when used in paired mode. The
integration of a fix for this is being tracked in https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/23

annotate-partitions.py only outputs FASTA even if given a FASTQ file. This
issue is being tracked in https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/46

A user reported that abundance-dist-single.py fails with small files and many
threads. This issue is being tracked in https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/75
