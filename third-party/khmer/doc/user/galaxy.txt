Deploying the khmer project tools on Galaxy
===========================================

This document is for people interested in deploying the khmer tools on
the Galaxy platform.

----

We are developing the support for running all the khmer scripts in `Galaxy
<http://galaxyproject.org/>`__.

Install the tools & tool description
------------------------------------

In the administrative interface select "Search and browse tool sheds" under
the heading "Tool sheds". Click on "Galaxy test tool shed" and search for
khmer. Click on the "khmer" button and choose "Preview and install". Click the
"Install to Galaxy" button at the top. At the bottom of the next page click
the "Install" button.

Single Output Usage
-------------------

For one or more files into a single file:

#. Choose 'Normalize By Median' from the 'khmer protocols' section of the
'Tools' menu.

#. Compatible files already uploaded to your Galaxy instance should be listed.
If not then you may need to `set their datatype manually
<https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn/Datatypes>`__.

#. After selecting the input files specify if they are paired-interleaved
or not.

#. Specify the sample type or show the advanced parameters to set the tablesize
yourself. Consult :doc:`../user/choosing-table-sizes` for assistance.
