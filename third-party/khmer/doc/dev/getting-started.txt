Getting started with khmer development
======================================

This document is for people who would like to contribute to khmer.  It
walks first-time contributors through making their own copy of khmer,
building it, and submitting changes for review and merge into the master
copy of khmer.

----

Start by making your own copy of khmer and setting yourself up for
development; then, build khmer and run the tests; and finally, claim
an issue and start developing!

If you're unfamiliar with git and branching in particular, check out
the `git-scm book <http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching>`__.

We've provided a quick guide to the khmer code base here:
:doc:`codebase-guide`.

One-time Preparation
--------------------

#. Install the dependencies.

   OS X users

   a.  Install Xcode from the `Mac App Store (requires root)
       <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_.
   #.  `Register as an Apple Developer
       <https://developer.apple.com/register>`__.
   #.  Install the Xcode command-line tools: Xcode -> preferences ->
       Downloads -> Command Line Tools (requires root).

   Linux users

   a.  Install the python development environment, virtualenv, pip, gcc, and
       g++.

       On recent Debian and Ubuntu this can be done with::

           sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev python-virtualenv python-pip gcc \
           g++

       For RHEL6::

           sudo yum install -y python-devel python-pip git gcc gcc-c++ make
           sudo pip install virtualenv

#. Get a `GitHub <http://github.com>`__ account.

   (We use GitHub to manage khmer contributions.)

#. Fork `github.com/ged-lab/khmer <http://github.com/ged-lab/khmer>`__.

   Visit that page, and then click on the 'fork' button (upper right).

   (This makes a copy of the khmer source code in your own GitHub account.)

#. Clone your copy of khmer to your local development environment.

   Your clone URL should look something like this::

       https://github.com/empty-titus/khmer.git

   and the UNIX shell command should be::

       git clone https://github.com/empty-titus/khmer.git

   (This makes a local copy of khmer on your development machine.)

#. Add a git reference to the khmer ged-lab repository::

       cd khmer
       git remote add ged https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer.git
       cd ../

   (This makes it easy for you to pull down the latest changes in the
   main repository.)

#. Create a virtual Python environment within which to work with
   `virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`__::

       python2.7 -m virtualenv env

   This gives you a place to install packages necessary for running khmer.

   OS X users and others may need to download virtualenv first::

	curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.11.6.tar.gz
	tar xzf virtualenv*
	cd virtualenv-*; python2.7 virtualenv.py ../env; cd ..

   `Conda <https://github.com/conda/conda>`__ users on any platform can install
   virtualenv this way::

       conda install pip
       hash -r
       pip install virtualenv
       python2.7 -m virtualenv env 

#. Activate the virtualenv and install a few packages::

       source env/bin/activate
       cd khmer
       make install-dependencies

   (This installs `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ and `nose
   <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__, packages we use for
   building the documentation and running the tests.)

Building khmer and running the tests
------------------------------------

#. Activate (or re-activate) the virtualenv::

      source ../env/bin/activate

   You can run this many times without any ill effects.

   (This puts you in the development environment.)

#. Build khmer::

      make

   If this fails, we apologize -- please `go create a new issue
   <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open>`__,
   paste in the failure message, and we'll try to help you work through it!

   (This takes the C++ source code and compiles it into something that Python
   can run.)

#. Run the tests::

      make test

   You should see lots of output, with something like::

      Ran 360 tests in 10.403s

      OK

   at the end.

   (This will run all of the Python tests in the tests/ directory.)

Congratulations! You're ready to develop!

Claiming an issue and starting to develop
------------------------------------------

#. Find an open issue and claim it.

   Go to `the list of open khmer issues
   <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open>`__
   and find one you like; we suggest starting with `the low-hanging fruit issues <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues?direction=desc&labels=low-hanging-fruit&page=1&sort=created&state=open>`__).

   Once you've found an issue you like, make sure that no one has been
   assigned to it (see "assignee", bottom right near "notifications").
   Then, add a comment "I am working on this issue." You've staked
   your claim!

   (We're trying to avoid having multiple people working on the same issue.)

#. In your local copy of the source code, update your master branch
   from the main khmer master branch::

      git checkout master
      git pull ged master

   (This pulls in all of the latest changes from whatever we've been
   doing on ged-lab.)

#. Create a new branch and link it to your fork on GitHub::

      git checkout -b fix/issue_number
      git push -u origin fix/issue_number

   where you replace "issue_number" with the number of the issue.

   (This is the set of changes you're going to ask to be merged into khmer.)

#. Make some changes and commit them.

   This will be issue dependent ;).

   (You should visit and read :doc:`coding-guidelines-and-review`.)

#. Periodically update your branch from the main khmer master branch::

      git pull ged master

   (This pulls in all of the latest changes from whatever we've been
   doing on ged-lab - important especially during periods of fast change
   or for long-running pull requests.

#. Run the tests and/or build the docs *before* pushing to GitHub::

      make doc test pep8

   Make sure they all pass!

#. Push your branch to your own GitHub fork::

      git push origin

   (This pushes all of your changes to your own fork.)

#. Repeat until you're ready to merge your changes into "official" khmer.

#. Set up a Pull Request asking to merge things into the central khmer
   repository.

   In a Web browser, go to your GitHub fork of khmer, e.g.::

      https://github.com/empty-titus/khmer

   and you will see a list of "recently pushed branches" just above the
   source code listing.  On the right side of that should be a
   "Compare & pull request" green button.  Click on it!

   Now:

     * add a descriptive title ("updated tests for XXX")
     * put the issue number in the comment ("fixes issue #532")
   
   then click "Create pull request."

   (This creates a new issue where we can all discuss your proposed
   changes; the khmer team will be automatically notified and you will
   receive e-mail notifications as we add comments.  See `GitHub flow
   <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__ for more
   info.)

#. Paste in the committer checklist from :doc:`coding-guidelines-and-review`
   and, after its pasted in, check off as many of the boxes as you can.

#. As you add new commits to address bugs or formatting issues, you can keep
   pushing your changes to the pull request by doing::

      git push origin

#. When you are ready to have the pull request reviewed, please add a
   comment "ready for review!".

#. The khmer team will now review your pull request and communicate
   with you through the pull request page.  Please feel free to add
   'ping!' in the comments if you are looking for feedback -- this
   will alert us that you are still on the line -- but we will
   automatically get notified of your pull request and any new
   comments, so use sparingly.

   If this is still your first issue, please *don't* take another issue until
   we've merged your first one - thanks!

#. If we request changes, return to the step "Make some changes and
   commit them" and go from there.  Any additional commits you make and
   push to your branch will automatically be added to the pull request
   (which is pretty dang cool.)

After your first issue is successfully merged...
------------------------------------------------

You're now an experienced GitHub user!  Go ahead and take some more
tasks; you can broaden out beyond the low hanging fruit if you like.

Here are a few suggestions:

* If you're knowledgeable in C++ and/or Python and/or documentation
  and/or biology, we'd love to attract further contributions to khmer.
  Please visit the issues list and browse about and find something
  interesting looking.

* One general thing we'd like to do is increase our test coverage.
  You can go find test coverage information `on our continuous
  integration server
  <http://ci.ged.msu.edu/job/khmer-master/label=linux/cobertura>`__ by
  clicking down to individual files; or, ask us on
  khmer-project@idyll.org for suggestions.

* Ask us! Ask khmer-project@idyll.org for suggestions on what to do next.
  We can suggest particularly ripe low-hanging fruit, or find some other
  issues that suit your interests and background.

* You can also help other people out by watching for new issues or
  looking at pull requests.  Remember to be nice and polite!
