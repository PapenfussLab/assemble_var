Development miscellany
======================

Third-party use
---------------

We ask that third parties who build upon the codebase to do so from a
versioned release. This will help them determine when bug fixes apply and
generally make it easier to collaborate. If more intensive modifications happen
then we request that the repository is forked, again preferably from a version
tag.

Build framework
---------------

'make' should build everything, including tests and "development" code.

git and GitHub strategies
-------------------------

Still in the works, but read `this
<http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__.

Make a branch on ged-lab (preferred so others can contribute) or fork the
repository and make a branch there.

Each piece or fix you are working on should have its own branch; make a pull-
request to ged-lab/master to aid in code review, testing, and feedback.

If you want your code integrated then it needs to be mergable

Example pull request update using the command line:

 #. Clone the source of the pull request (if needed)
     ``git clone git@github.com:mr-c/khmer.git``
 #. Checkout the source branch of the pull request
     ``git checkout my-pull-request``
 #. Pull in the destination of the pull request and resolve any conflicts
     ``git pull git@github.com:ged-lab/khmer.git master``
 #. Push your update to the source of the pull request ``git push``
 #. Jenkins will automatically attempt to build and test your pull requests.

Code coverage
-------------

Jenkins calculates code coverage for every build. Navigate to the results from
the master node first to view the coverage information.

Code coverage should never go down and new functionality needs to be tested.

Pipelines
---------

All khmer scripts used by a published recommended analysis pipeline must be
included in scripts/ and meet the standards therein implied.

Command line scripts
--------------------

Python command-line scripts should use '-' instead of '_' in the name.
(Only filenames containing code for import imported should use _.)

Please follow the command-line conventions used under scripts/.  This
includes most especially standardization of '-x' to be hash table size,
'-N' to be number of hash tables, and '-k' to always refer to the
k-mer size.

Command line thoughts:

   If a filename is required, typically UNIX commands don't use a flag to
   specify it.

   Also, positional arguments typically aren't used with multiple files.

   CTB's overall philosophy is that new files, with new names, should
   be created as the result of filtering etc.; this allows easy
   chaining of commands.  We're thinking about how best to allow
   override of this, e.g. ::

      filter-abund.py <ct file> <filename> [ -o <filename.keep> ]

----

All code in scripts/ must have automated tests; see tests/test_scripts.py.
Otherwise it belongs in sandbox/.

When files are overwritten, they should only be opened to be overwritten
after the input files have been shown to exist.  That prevents stupid
command like mistakes from trashing important files.

It would be nice to allow piping from one command to another where possible.
But this seems complicated.

CTB: should we squash output files (overwrite them if they exist), or not?
So far, leaning towards 'not', as that way no one is surprised and loses
their data.

A general error should be signaled by exit code `1` and success by `0`. Linux
supports exit codes from `0` to `255` where the value `1` means a general
error. An exit code of `-1` will get converted to `255`.

Python / C integration
----------------------

The Python extension that wraps the C++ core of khmer lives in
khmer/_khmermodule.CC

This wrapper code is tedious and annoying so we use a static analysis tool to
check for correctness.

https://gcc-python-plugin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cpychecker.html

Developers using Ubuntu Precise will want to install the gcc-4.6-plugin-dev
package

Example usage: ::

	CC="/home/mcrusoe/src/gcc-plugin-python/gcc-python-plugin/gcc-with-cpychecker
	--maxtrans=512" python setup.py build_ext 2>&1 | less

False positives abound: ignore errors about the C++ standard library. This tool
is primarily useful for reference count checking, error-handling checking, and
format string checking.

Errors to ignore: "Unhandled Python exception raised calling 'execute' method",
"AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'file'"

Warnings to address: ::

        khmer/_khmermodule.cc:3109:1: note: this function is too complicated
        for the reference-count checker to fully analyze: not all paths were
        analyzed

Adjust --maxtrans and re-run. ::

	khmer/_khmermodule.cc:2191:61: warning: Mismatching type in call to
	Py_BuildValue with format code "i" [enabled by default]
	  argument 2 ("D.68937") had type
	    "long long unsigned int"
	  but was expecting
	    "int"
	  for format code "i"

See below for a format string cheat sheet One also benefits by matching C type
with the function signature used later. 

"I" for unsigned int
"K" for unsigned long long a.k.a khmer::HashIntoType.
